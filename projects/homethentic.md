## 🏡 Neighbourhood Meal Service (2020 – 2021)

**Role**: Co-Founder / No-Code Developer
**Tech:** Bubble.io, FSA API, Stripe, Sendmail, ClickUp

Marketplace platform built during lockdown for local home cooks to sell their home-cooked meals in their neighbourhoods, specialising in multicultural dishes and dietary requirements.
### 🎯 Objective

To create a fast, secure, and accessible **neighbourhood meal service** where local home-cooks and professional cooks could create verified profiles, validate their food hygiene knowledge, and showcase their recipes to customers in their local area — all with minimal friction, and no coding or app install required.

### 🛠️ What I Built

- Developed the platform using **Bubble**, a no-code environment ideal for rapid prototyping and deployment, integrating:
	- **Food Standards Agency** APIs for hygiene ratings, renewal checks
	- Postal address lookups via external services
	- **Stripe** for payments, payouts and ID verification
	- **ClickUp** Webhooks to automate onboarding and project management
	- **Sendmail** for transactional and marketing emails
- Features included:
	- Cook onboarding exam supplementing the FSA criteria
	- Recipe listings dishes as one-off, recurring, or special-event meals
	- Detailed recipe pages with photos, ingredients, dietary info, ratings, and moderated reviews
	- Customer browsing by dietary needs, availability, and location
- Took the platform from concept to live launch under rapid timelines

**Outcome**: Shut down due to insufficient local cook participation to sustain the business model
