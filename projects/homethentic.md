**Role**: Co-Founder / No-Code Developer (Bubble.io)

**Year**: 2020

  

Marketplace platform built during lockdown for local home cooks to sell meals in their neighbourhoods.

  

- Developed MVP rapidly using **Bubble.io**, integrating:
	- **FSA** APIs for hygiene ratings and renewal checks
	- Postal address lookups via external services
	- **Stripe** for payments and payouts
	- **ClickUp** Webhooks to automate onboarding and project management
	- **Sendmail** for transactional and marketing emails
- Features included:
	- Cooks listing dishes as one-off, recurring, or special-event meals
	- Detailed recipe pages with photos, ingredients, dietary info, ratings, and moderated reviews
	- Customer browsing by dietary needs, availability, and location
- Took the platform from concept to live launch under rapid timelines
- **Outcome**: Shut down due to insufficient local cook participation to sustain the business model
