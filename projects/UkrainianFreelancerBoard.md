## 🌍 Ukrainian Freelancer Support Platform (2022–Present)

**Role:** Platform Designer & No-Code Developer  
**Tech:** Bubble.io, LinkedIn OAuth integration, profile tagging, manual moderation workflows

At the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, I was approached via social media (likely Reddit or Twitter) by a Ukrainian living in London who was determined to help displaced friends, family, and fellow citizens find work and economic independence.

### 🎯 Objective

To create a fast, secure, and accessible **freelancer platform** where Ukrainian professionals could create verified profiles, connect with potential clients, and showcase their skills — all with minimal friction, and no coding or app install required.

### 🛠️ What I Built

- Developed the platform using **Bubble**, a no-code environment ideal for rapid prototyping and deployment.
- Integrated **LinkedIn OAuth** for soft identity verification and to reduce abuse/spam registrations.
- Enabled **user-generated profiles** with:
  - Bio, skills, and work samples
  - Tagging by industry, toolset, or professional focus
  - Visibility settings and lightweight moderation tools
- Designed a clean, mobile-friendly interface to make the platform accessible regardless of hardware or network strength.
- Implemented basic admin controls for the founder to manage and approve listings as needed.

### 🌱 Lasting Impact

- Delivered a **live, working platform within weeks**, enabling displaced Ukrainians to highlight their skills and seek remote work.
- Platform remains operational and continues to be maintained by the original founder.
- Demonstrated the value of **no-code tools in humanitarian and grassroots tech**, enabling low-overhead collaboration and rapid deployment.

**Result:** A fast, practical, and resilient digital space offering opportunity and visibility for Ukrainian freelancers when it was most urgently needed.
