## 🛝 RoSPA Play Safety – Inspection Scheduling & Reporting System (2012–2015)

**Role:** Lead Developer (via Decent Group)  
**Tech:** FileMaker Pro, custom scheduling logic, mobile data sync, contract-driven automation

While working as Lead Developer at Decent Group, I partnered with stakeholders at **RoSPA Play Safety** to design and deliver a system to digitise their playground inspection workflows — covering scheduling, compliance, and reporting for local councils and parish contracts across the UK.

### 🧱 Challenges

- RoSPA was managing inspections using **manual planning** and **paper-based reports**.
- Inspections varied by contract type — monthly, quarterly, or annual — each with different reporting and timing obligations.
- Inspectors often worked in the field with **no network access**, and reports had to be returned to HQ and processed manually.
- Missed or duplicated inspections were common, causing reputational risk and inefficiencies.

### 🛠️ What I Delivered

- Designed and built a **custom FileMaker-based planning and scheduling system**, enabling:
  - Automated contract-based inspection planning, honouring contract terms and time windows.
  - Clear visibility of inspection status across clients, inspectors, and timeframes.
- Developed an **offline-first mobile reporting system**:
  - Allowed inspectors to complete reports in the field on iPads, even without network signal.
  - Integrated photo capture, checklist completion, and risk grading directly in the app.
- Delivered a centralised dashboard for managers to monitor inspection status, generate reports, and maintain compliance across multiple clients.

### 📈 Business Impact

- **Reduced planning workload by 90%** — automated scheduling saved substantial admin time.
- **Eliminated missed inspections**, enabling RoSPA to deliver consistent and compliant service to councils.
- Improved transparency and accountability in safety reporting — supporting RoSPA's commitment to play safety across the UK.

**Result:** A scalable, field-ready inspection system that enhanced RoSPA’s service delivery and underpinned long-term contract success with local authorities.
