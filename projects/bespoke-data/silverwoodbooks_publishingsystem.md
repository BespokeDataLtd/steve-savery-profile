## 📚 SilverWood Books – Publishing Operations Platform (2012–Present)

**Role:** Lead Developer & Systems Consultant (via Bespoke Data Ltd)  
**Tech:** FileMaker Pro, Excel/CSV automation, self-billing logic, custom import parsing

SilverWood Books is an independent publishing company offering professional publishing services to authors — from editing and design to distribution and royalty processing. I was introduced to the company’s founder through a mutual contact and was asked to build a bespoke database to manage the entire operational pipeline.

### 🛠️ What I Built

- Designed and developed a **FileMaker-based business system** to handle the day-to-day running of the publishing operation, tailored to their unique workflow.
- Key features included:
  - **Author records** and contract-specific metadata
  - **Publications module** covering books across multiple formats (paperback, hardback, ePub, etc.)
  - **Stock management** across suppliers and distribution channels
  - **Sales import pipeline**:
    - Ingests and processes Excel/CSV files from multiple physical and electronic sales sources (e.g., Amazon, IngramSpark)
    - Consolidates and reconciles multi-format, multi-source sales data per title and author
  - **Self-billing system** that:
    - Applies author-specific commission rules
    - Generates automated statements and payment logs
- Provided workflow design to help non-technical staff easily manage imports, error-checking, and payout timing.

### 🔄 Business Outcomes

- Eliminated previously manual spreadsheet-based sales reconciliation.
- Provided a clear, repeatable process for **royalty calculation** and author payments.
- Improved internal visibility of stock, suppliers, and active sales across formats and channels.
- System remains in daily use, underpinning SilverWood Books’ author-facing operations.

**Result:** A reliable, extensible platform that streamlined a complex publishing workflow and freed the team to focus on author services rather than administration.
