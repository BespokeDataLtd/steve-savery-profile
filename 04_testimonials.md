His work was pivotal to our business.  
>   
> Steve is reliable, methodical, and trustworthy. He has taken on large data challenges as well as small but meaningful enhancements, and handled all with deep skill and patience. His creativity and thoughtful approach led to business-enhancing improvements and his contributions have leave a lasting impact on our team.  
>

> “It has been my great pleasure to work with Steve Savery for more than 25 years – since well before the time he set up Bespoke Data Ltd in 2007.
> 
> I first came across Steve in the 1990s when I was a partner in the firm of Wasley Knight Communication – an agency designed to supply editorial writing and design skills to multiple different industries and companies. Steve was tasked with keeping our equipment operating, using various different platforms, and making sure that we always hit our editorial deadlines.
> 
> When I set up Knight Train & Consult Ltd, coincidently also in 2007, I asked Steve to become my IT consultant on an agency basis, a task he undertook until I closed Knight Train and Consult Ltd on my retirement last year.
> 
> In all the time I have known him, Steve has been a diligent worker, always willing to go the extra mile so that my business wouldn’t suffer. I can honestly say that there has never been a technology problem that Steve hasn’t been able to solve – I sometimes think the bigger the problem the more he relishes the challenge.
> 
> As a journalist for more than 50 years, a Fellow of the British Association of Communicators in Business, and the managing director of a company, I am well used to assessing who is and who isn’t good at their jobs; who tells the truth; who is honest and who is trustworthy. Based on everything I have known about Steve for the last 30 years, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that, should you employ him, he will bring only credit to your organisation.”

>"When we first began working together in 2013, our FileMaker system was unreliable and difficult to use, having originally been built by someone with limited experience. Steve quickly stabilised the platform and helped us regain control of our data.
>
>As our business moved online during the Covid period, he developed a custom CRM using Bubble, enabling us to adapt quickly and provide efficient remote access for our virtual assistants.
>
>When our business model recently shifted back to more in-house operations, Steve once again took the lead—expertly rebuilding our systems in a secure, high-performance Ruby on Rails environment, which we now host internally. This transition significantly reduced our ongoing costs and gave us full control over our infrastructure.
>
>Throughout our collaboration, Steve has been pragmatic, honest, and forward-thinking, guiding us through every technical decision with our business goals in mind. He possesses the rare ability to quickly understand individual needs, learning styles, and working preferences, allowing him to design systems that are intuitive, user-friendly, and tailored to diverse working approaches.
>
>He has always been approachable and responsive, offering assistance with any queries in a calm and reassuring manner."

>"Steve built a bespoke client information and author royalty system for my small company all the way back in 2013. It was exactly what I needed and wanted, and the system has continued to work well ever since. I still use it on a daily basis to access information, or update with new info and book sales information. Steve is always there when I need him, and responds quickly and helpfully."
