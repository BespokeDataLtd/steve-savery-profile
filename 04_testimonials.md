## Testimonials

> “It’s been a privilege to work with Steve for the past eight years. He took on the monumental task of building our IT system from the ground up —an incredibly complex platform including bookings, payment processing, invoicing, insurance claims, and other highly functional tools. His work was pivotal to our business.  
>   
> Steve is reliable, methodical, and trustworthy. He has taken on large data challenges as well as small but meaningful enhancements, and handled all with deep skill and patience. His creativity and thoughtful approach led to business-enhancing improvements and his contributions have leave a lasting impact on our team.  
>   
> Beyond his technical ability, Steve has been an absolute pleasure to work with - always collaborative and dedicated. He would be a true asset to anyone he works with.”

> “It has been my great pleasure to work with Steve Savery for more than 25 years – since well before the time he set up Bespoke Data Ltd in 2007.
> 
> I first came across Steve in the 1990s when I was a partner in the firm of Wasley Knight Communication – an agency designed to supply editorial writing and design skills to multiple different industries and companies. Steve was tasked with keeping our equipment operating, using various different platforms, and making sure that we always hit our editorial deadlines.
> 
> When I set up Knight Train & Consult Ltd, coincidently also in 2007, I asked Steve to become my IT consultant on an agency basis, a task he undertook until I closed Knight Train and Consult Ltd on my retirement last year.
> 
> In all the time I have known him, Steve has been a diligent worker, always willing to go the extra mile so that my business wouldn’t suffer. I can honestly say that there has never been a technology problem that Steve hasn’t been able to solve – I sometimes think the bigger the problem the more he relishes the challenge.
> 
> As a journalist for more than 50 years, a Fellow of the British Association of Communicators in Business, and the managing director of a company, I am well used to assessing who is and who isn’t good at their jobs; who tells the truth; who is honest and who is trustworthy. Based on everything I have known about Steve for the last 30 years, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that, should you employ him, he will bring only credit to your organisation.”
